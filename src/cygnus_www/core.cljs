Nearly every modern processor has some kind of SIMD extension, such as SSE and AVX on x86, NEON and ASIMD on ARM, MSA on MIPS, and Extension V on RISC-V. SIMD code can often process data much more quickly than regular code, but it can be difficult to write."]

All SIMD architectures have large registers which can hold vectors. AVX uses 256-bit vector registers, while NEON uses 128-bit registers."]
   [:p "SIMD architectures define instructions which can perform a single operation on every element of a vector. For example, the AVX instruction " [:code "vpaddb dest, src1, src2"] " adds each element in src1 to the element at the same position in src2, and stores it at that position in dest. The power of such an instruction should be apparent: With a 256-bit vector of bytes, we can perform 32 additions in a single cycle!"]
